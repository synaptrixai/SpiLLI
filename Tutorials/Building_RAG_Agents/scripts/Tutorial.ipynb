      "1. **Dynamic Resource Allocation** – Apps find the best host based on load, performance, and proximity.  \n",
      "2. **Decentralized Infrastructure** – Computing power is spread across many nodes, providing redundancy.  \n",
      "3. **Real‑time Adaptation** – Connections and allocations are continuously optimized.\n",

      "- **Ubuntu**  \n",
      "  1. Download the `.deb`: <https://github.com/synaptrixai/SpiLLI/releases/download/v0.3.2/SpiLLIHost-0.3.2-Linux-SpiLLIHost.deb>\n",
      "  2. Install:  \n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     sudo apt install ./SpiLLIHost-0.3.2-Linux-SpiLLIHost.deb\n",
      "     ```  \n",
      "  3. Move the PEM file to the host directory:  \n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     sudo mv SpiLLIHost_Community.pem /usr/bin/SpiLLIHost/\n",
      "     ```  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Windows**  \n",
      "  1. Download the installer: <https://github.com/synaptrixai/SpiLLI/releases/download/v0.3.2/SpiLLIHost-0.3.2-win64.exe>  \n",
      "  2. Run the setup. Ignore the unsigned‑signature warning.  \n",
      "  3. Select your `SpiLLIHost_Community.pem` during the installation process and follow prompts to complete the installation.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the installation is complete, SpiLLIHost is automatically started as a service on windows/ubuntu and nothing further needs to be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "To manage the **Service**  \n",
      "   - **Windows**: Use the Windows *Services* console [can be found by typing \"Services\" in the windows start search bar]. Double click the \n",
      "   SpiLLIHost service in the Windows Services UI to open a dialog to start/stop/restart/or check the service status.  \n",
      "   - **Ubuntu**: Use systemctl in the terminal as admin. `sudo systemctl start [ other options: stop/restart/status] SpiLLIHost.service`.  \n",
      "\n",
      "> **Troubleshooting** The SpiLLIHost service will not run if there is no encryption file provided. If the service fails to start check if your downloaded pem file is stored in the installed directory (\"/usr/bin/SpiLLIHost\" for Ubuntu, \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SpiLLIHost\\bin\" by default on Windows). The pem file should be named as  SpiLLIHost_Community.pem\n",

While it is true that the document relating to installation for SpiLLI SDK (scoringing high on keyword similarity) is relevant, it is not exactly what we asked for. We had to explicitly put the keywords \"decentralized AI\" and \"principles\" in our second query to coax out the document from the retriever similarity search that would have been more meaningful in responding to a query like \"What can you tell me about SpiLLI\". \n",

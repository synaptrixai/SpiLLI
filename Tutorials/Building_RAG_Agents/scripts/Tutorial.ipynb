      "1. **Dynamic Resource Allocation** – Apps find the best host based on load, performance, and proximity.  \n",
      "2. **Decentralized Infrastructure** – Computing power is spread across many nodes, providing redundancy.  \n",
      "3. **Real‑time Adaptation** – Connections and allocations are continuously optimized.\n",

      "- **Ubuntu**  \n",
      "  1. Download the `.deb`: <https://github.com/synaptrixai/SpiLLI/releases/download/v0.3.2/SpiLLIHost-0.3.2-Linux-SpiLLIHost.deb>\n",
      "  2. Install:  \n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     sudo apt install ./SpiLLIHost-0.3.2-Linux-SpiLLIHost.deb\n",
      "     ```  \n",
      "  3. Move the PEM file to the host directory:  \n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     sudo mv SpiLLIHost_Community.pem /usr/bin/SpiLLIHost/\n",
      "     ```  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Windows**  \n",
      "  1. Download the installer: <https://github.com/synaptrixai/SpiLLI/releases/download/v0.3.2/SpiLLIHost-0.3.2-win64.exe>  \n",
      "  2. Run the setup. Ignore the unsigned‑signature warning.  \n",
      "  3. Select your `SpiLLIHost_Community.pem` during the installation process and follow prompts to complete the installation.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the installation is complete, SpiLLIHost is automatically started as a service on windows/ubuntu and nothing further needs to be done.\n",
      "\n",
      "To manage the **Service**  \n",
      "   - **Windows**: Use the Windows *Services* console [can be found by typing \"Services\" in the windows start search bar]. Double click the \n",
      "   SpiLLIHost service in the Windows Services UI to open a dialog to start/stop/restart/or check the service status.  \n",
      "   - **Ubuntu**: Use systemctl in the terminal as admin. `sudo systemctl start [ other options: stop/restart/status] SpiLLIHost.service`.  \n",
      "\n",
      "> **Troubleshooting** The SpiLLIHost service will not run if there is no encryption file provided. If the service fails to start check if your downloaded pem file is stored in the installed directory (\"/usr/bin/SpiLLIHost\" for Ubuntu, \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\SpiLLIHost\\bin\" by default on Windows). The pem file should be named as  SpiLLIHost_Community.pem\n",

    "With the above code we implemented a naive RAG system, where a similarity search is performed directly on the user query to the documents and the closest documents are added to the context of the LLM for generating a response to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is ok to do in principle, it does not always yield the best results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why you may ask?  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform context retrieval this way, we only look at keywords similarity between keywords in the query and the document objects. But relevance of the document is not just be a matter of searching for keywords, there is often meaning in non keywords, for example \"Tell me about SpiLLI\", yields \"To install SpiLLI SDK, ...\", not quite capturing the intent of what we asked. While it is true that the document relating to installation for SpiLLI SDK (scoringing high on keyword similarity) is relevant, it is not exactly what we asked for. We had to explicitly put the keywords \"decentralized AI\" and \"principles\" in our second query to coax out the document from the retriever similarity search that would have been more meaningful in responding to a query like \"What can you tell me about SpiLLI\". \n",
